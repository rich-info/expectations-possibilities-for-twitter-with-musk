# Expectations for Twitter after the acquisition by Elon Musk and the enhancement possibilities of the platform.

Elon Musk is not only the richest man in the world, he is currently also one of the most intelligent and well-known people in the universe. After becoming the owner of twitter, many users hope that an edit button will be introduced and the verification of users with a checkmark will be faster and easier. 
But what progress and benefits will such little things like a button or a check mark bring to humanity? 

## One should have much higher ambitions. You can certainly have much higher expectations from Elon Musk.

A man of Elon Musk's caliber is capable of achieving greater things. He certainly don't buy Twitter for profit. Does he want to promote freedom of expression in the social networks? Or does he want to influence opinion and possibly become president?
